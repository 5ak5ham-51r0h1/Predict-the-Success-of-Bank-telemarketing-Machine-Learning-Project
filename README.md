Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis
For Kaggle Competition - https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predict-the-success-of-bank-telemarketing
a community prediction competition hosted by iitm

Project Overview
This project analyzes direct marketing campaigns conducted by a banking institution. The campaigns were executed through phone calls, with multiple contacts sometimes necessary to determine if a client would subscribe to a bank term deposit. The goal is to predict whether a client will subscribe to the term deposit ('yes') or not ('no').

Dataset Description
The dataset contains various client-related features including:
•	Demographics (age, job, marital status, education)
•	Financial indicators (balance, housing loan, personal loan)
•	Campaign-specific information (contact duration, campaign frequency)
•	Historical context (previous campaign outcomes)

Technical Implementation
The solution implements a comprehensive machine learning pipeline including:
Data Processing
•	Feature engineering for date-related columns
•	Binary variable encoding
•	Handling missing values through imputation
•	Standardization of numerical features
•	One-hot encoding for categorical variables
Model Architecture
The final solution employs a stacking ensemble approach combining:
•	Random Forest Classifier
•	Gradient Boosting Classifier
•	Neural Network (MLP)
•	Support Vector Machine
•	K-Nearest Neighbors
•	Naive Bayes
•	Logistic Regression (meta-learner)
Feature Selection & Dimensionality Reduction
•	PCA implementation for dimensionality reduction
•	SelectKBest with mutual information for feature selection
•	Comprehensive feature importance analysis

Model Performance
The stacking ensemble model achieves robust performance through:
•	Cross-validation to ensure reliability
•	F1-score optimization for balanced prediction
•	Comprehensive validation against holdout data
•	Multiple base models to capture different patterns in the data

Visualization
The project includes various visualizations:
•	Target variable distribution
•	Feature distributions and correlations
•	Box plots for numerical features vs target
•	Stacked bar plots for categorical features

Future Improvements
•	Feature engineering based on domain knowledge
•	Hyperparameter optimization using Bayesian methods
•	Implementing more sophisticated ensemble techniques
•	Deep learning approaches for feature extraction

Requirements
•	Python 3.x
•	pandas
•	numpy
•	scikit-learn
•	xgboost
•	matplotlib
•	seaborn
